# Java Learning Repository

This repository documents my complete Core Java learning journey, organized in a structured and dependency-based manner.

It covers Java fundamentals, object-oriented programming (OOP), modern Java features (Java 8+), collections framework, multithreading, exception handling, and stream API.  
Alongside conceptual learning, the repository also includes problem-solving notes and solutions from various competitive programming platforms, highlighting new concepts, syntax, and patterns learned during practice.

The folder structure follows a logical progression to ensure clarity, easy revision, and strong conceptual understanding.  
This repository is intended for learning, revision, and reference purposes as I continue strengthening my Java and problem-solving skills.
